            The values, customs, culture, and artifacts passed down from past generations make up a person's distinctive, inherited sense of national identity. <br> As we watch and experience the elements that make our community special, <br> we absorb a sense of our history throughout our lives.

                    With approximately 3000 years of civilization, Sri Lanka is home to some of the world's most ancient towns, such as Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, and Digamadulla. In the midst of the soaring mountains, remnants of these once splendid cities, their palaces, temples, monasteries, hospitals, and theaters exquisitely sculpted and fashioned out of stone, lie abandoned.
                    The Kingdom of Anuradhapura is the most famous and beautiful of all the ancient sites. Sri Lanka's third and longest-serving capital, as well as one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities, is also one of the world's most sacred Buddhist capitals. It served as the capital of Sri Lanka from the fourth century BC to the eleventh century AD, and was one of the most stable and long-lasting governmental centers in the country.

                    In the ninth century BC, Polonnaruwa, the country's second-oldest kingdom, was appointed the country's governmental capital. In the Polonnaruwa kingdom, irrigation systems far better to those of the Anuradhapura Age were built, and they still provide irrigation water to farmers in and around Polonnaruwa. The kingdom's glory, however, was short-lived, and by the eleventh century, a South Indian invasion had pushed the political center to the country's center. The ancient city of Polonnaruwa is still one of the country's best-planned archaeological relic sites, a testament to the Kingdom's first rulers' discipline and magnificence.

                    During the Anuradhapura monarchy, Digamadulla, Sri Lanka's Eastern kingdom, was the country's agricultural and spiritual capital. Digamadulla was a rich region ruled by a viceroy of the Anuradhapura king, with splendid palaces, monasteries, and temples at every turn. Many remarkable masterpieces of ancient Digamadulla have been lost to time, conflict, and looting, while many more silently await in the middle of the forests that blanket the plains of Eastern Sri Lanka, having gotten less attention from archaeologists than Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa.
