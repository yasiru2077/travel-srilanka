rumassala

Rumassala is a small hill with forest cover situated closer to the beach. The famous story of Rumassala related to Ramayana which is a mythical encounter between Rama and Ravana. When Rama’s brother-Lakshman was near-fatally injured in battle, it needed to bring some herbals from the Himalayas. Hanuman the monkey god has undertaken the task, but he forgot the name of the herbs. Hanuman broke a part of one mountain (Holy Sanjeevi) where herbs occurred and rest of the mountain was thrown away after getting the herbs. This fallen part was the origin of Rumassala.
The colonial name of Rumassala is Buno Vista implies “pleasant view”.
